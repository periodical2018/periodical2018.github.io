      <h1 class="margin"> Vanadium Rich Springs Of Mt. Fuji</h1>
      <h2>By: Reyad Freeg
      </h2>

  <div class="container">

      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>
          “... an element or a drug that has desirable effects in test tubes is much different from knowing how to harness those effects and create a safe medicine that humans can consume. For all its potency, vanadium is still a dubious element for the body to
          metabolize. Among other things, it mysteriously raises and lowers blood glucose levels. That’s why, despite its mild toxicity, vanadium water from (as some sites claim) the vanadium rich springs of Mt. Fuji is sold online as a cure for diabetes”
        </p>
        <p>Vanadium is known to hold properties that cure type 2 diabetes but is currently being tested before it can be distributed to type 2 diabetes patients. Type 2 diabetes, also known as Diabetes mellitus type 2, is a long-term metabolic disorder that
          is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and lack of insulin. Unfortunately, it officially has no cure since pharmacies don’t have specific medications to cure it. However, in recent research vanadium showed to be a cure for
          diabetes. Many people who have obtained vanadium from Mt. Fuji luckily were able to use it as a cure for the disorder.
        </p>

        <p>Vanadium is a medium-hard, steel-blue metal. Although a lesser-known metal, it is quite valuable in the manufacturing process of steel alloys such as construction tools due to its malleable, ductile and corrosion-resistant qualities. Vanadium
          doesn’t exist as a free element in nature. However, it can be found in 65 different minerals including carnotite, patronite, magnetite, and vanadinite. In fact, Japan has a vanadium rich spring that goes across Mt. Fuji. The water contains minerals
          that are rich in vanadium. After daily treatments with Mt. Fuji groundwater containing natural vanadium, blood glucose, serum hemoglobin A1C levels, and insulin secretion from the pancreas were improved. In the liver insulin receptors, the binding
          properties of insulin, and the activities of insulin receptor beta subunit and primary insulin-like growth factor all recovered to normal levels. These results suggest that daily treatment with small concentrations, a bottle of water, of natural
          vanadium improves hyperglycemia by ameliorating liver insulin receptor activity.

        </p>

        <p> Clearly, vanadium has beneficial effects after taking it in moderate concentrations. However, it can be very deadly. At higher doses, such as those used to treat diabetes, vanadium frequently causes unwanted side effects including abdominal discomfort,
          diarrhea, nausea, and gas. It can also cause a greenish tongue, loss of energy, and problems with the nervous system. Vanadium is unsafe when used in large amounts and for a long time. This increases the risk of serious side effects including
          kidney damage. Vanadium might lower blood sugar. People with diabetes should check their blood sugar carefully and watch for signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Thus, making it very difficult for scientists to synthesize it into medicine.
          Vanadium can be toxic in large amounts, many workers that work in factories were diagnosed with vanadium poisoning and some have died from it. Fortunately, people around the world have seen the positive effects from vanadium water in Mt. Fuji
          and started buying it. For example, Vanadium Water Company has been an international and has been heavily spreading their products in Pakistan because individuals from Pakistan own it. Many websites, such as Vanadium Water.com, have been made
          to sell vanadium water causing people worldwide to start buying vanadium water in Mt. Fuji to cure diabetes and for its health benefits.
